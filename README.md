For this project, I implemented four numerical methods for approximating definite integrals
and use these to estimate the value of Ï€. By divvying up the interval of integration into smaller
pieces, it should result in more accurate estimates.

"pi.c" -- Project implemenation

Instructions to build/run program:
  - To build, type: make all
  - To run pi.c, type: ./pi
  - To remove/clean, type: make clean
