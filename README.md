For this project, I implemented four numerical methods for approximating definite integrals
and use these to estimate the value of Ï€. By divvying up the interval of integration into smaller
pieces, it should result in more accurate estimates.

Rules:
- Trapezoid Rule
- Simpson's 1/3 Rule
- Simpson's 3/8 Rule
- Boole's Rule


"pi.c" -- Project implementation

Instructions to build/run the program:
  - To build, type: make all
  - To run pi.c, type: ./pi
  - To remove/clean, type: make clean
